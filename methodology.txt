Cannabis Document Classification Methodology
===========================================

Scoring System Overview:
The system uses a weighted keyword-based approach with context modifiers to score
documents for cannabis business relevance. The methodology is designed to identify
documents that represent immediate business opportunities or require monitoring.

Keyword Categories:

1. HIGH VALUE KEYWORDS (10 points each):
   - "cannabis retail", "dispensary license", "application window"
   - "ordinance approved", "licensing program", "application period"
   - "merit-based selection", "conditional use permit approved", "second reading"
   
   Rationale: These phrases indicate immediate business opportunities, active
   licensing processes, or approved regulatory changes that create new markets.

2. MEDIUM VALUE KEYWORDS (5 points each):
   - "public hearing", "planning commission", "draft ordinance"
   - "zoning amendment", "social equity", "moratorium lifted"
   - "cannabis business", "study session"
   
   Rationale: These indicate regulatory processes in progress, potential future
   opportunities, or policy discussions that require monitoring.

3. LOW VALUE KEYWORDS (2 points each):
   - "cannabis", "marijuana", "dispensary", "retail"
   - "tax revenue", "budget discussion", "general mention"
   
   Rationale: These are general mentions that may indicate background relevance
   but don't represent immediate opportunities.

Context Modifiers:

1. POSITIVE MODIFIERS (+3 points each):
   - "approved", "passed", "effective", "final"
   
   Rationale: These words indicate completed actions that create immediate
   business opportunities.

2. NEGATIVE MODIFIERS (-3 points each):
   - "prohibited", "banned", "rejected"
   
   Rationale: These words indicate restrictions that limit business opportunities.

3. DATE BONUS (+5 points for dates within 90 days):
   Rationale: Recent dates indicate current or upcoming opportunities that
   require immediate attention.

4. TITLE/HEADING BONUS (+2 points):
   Rationale: Keywords in titles or headings indicate the document's primary
   focus on cannabis-related matters.

Classification Thresholds:

- 70+ points: HIGH PRIORITY (immediate action needed)
- 30-69 points: MEDIUM PRIORITY (monitor and plan)
- 10-29 points: LOW PRIORITY (background awareness)
- Under 10 points: IRRELEVANT (ignore)

Automation Workflows:

1. HIGH PRIORITY: Immediate Slack alerts with detailed information
2. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Weekly digest emails for planning purposes
3. LOW PRIORITY: JSON logging for future reference
4. IRRELEVANT: No action taken

Business Logic Adjustments Made:

1. Enhanced date detection to handle multiple date formats
2. Added title/heading analysis for better context understanding
3. Implemented comprehensive keyword matching with case-insensitive search
4. Created detailed reasoning generation for transparency
5. Built robust automation workflows that match business needs

This methodology balances sensitivity (catching relevant documents) with specificity
(avoiding false positives) to provide actionable intelligence for cannabis business
opportunities.
