CITY COUNCIL SPECIAL MEETING
Date: January 10, 2025

EMERGENCY ITEM: CANNABIS MORATORIUM LIFTED

The council voted unanimously to lift the temporary moratorium on cannabis business 
applications. The moratorium was originally enacted to allow time for comprehensive 
ordinance development. With the new cannabis business regulations now in place, the 
moratorium is no longer necessary.

Effective immediately, new cannabis business applications may be submitted.
