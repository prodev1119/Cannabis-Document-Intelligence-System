PLANNING COMMISSION DECISION
Date: December 20, 2024

CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT DENIED: CANNABIS RETAIL

The commission denied a conditional use permit for a proposed cannabis retail location 
at 123 Main Street. The denial was based on proximity to schools and insufficient 
parking. The applicant may appeal the decision within 30 days.

Public hearing was held on December 15 with significant community opposition.
